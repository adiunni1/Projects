# Projects
A compilation of projects that I've done in the past. 
## Appointments: In this project, which was designed as a system to notify a user throughout the day of various activities/appointments planned in a day. The main feature of this project is determining whether or not any of the agendas conflict, i.e., whether they overlap in time. I used two Python classes, Appt (a single scheduled appointment with a start time, an end time, and a title) and Agenda (a list of Appt objects). Used constructor methods to create objects of a class and special methods (also called magic methods) that provide implementations for built-in functions like str and operators like < and ==.
