# Projects
A compilation of projects that I've done. 

## Appointments: In this project, which was designed as a system to notify a user throughout the day of various activities/appointments and determining whether or not any of the agendas conflict, i.e., whether they overlap in time. I used two Python classes, Appt (a single scheduled appointment with a start time, an end time, and a title) and Agenda (a list of Appt objects). Used constructor methods to create objects of a class and special methods (also called magic methods) that provide implementations for built-in functions like str and operators like < and ==.

## Movie Genre Classifier: This project involves building a machine learning classifier to predict the genre of movies (comedy or thriller) based on the text in their screenplays. The dataset contains 5,000 stemmed words extracted from conversations in movie scripts, along with metadata such as the movie's title, year, and rating. The primary goal is to explore the relationships between word usage and movie genres, train classifiers using K-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN), and evaluate their accuracy on unseen data. The project is a hands-on introduction to classification algorithms and exploratory data analysis. 
Key Features: 
- Word Stemming: Grouping related word forms (e.g., "managed," "managerial") into a single feature for analysis.
- Exploratory Data Analysis: Visualizing relationships between word proportions and movie genres.
- K-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) Classifier: Implementing and tuning k-NN to predict movie genres based on screenplay features.
- Model Evaluation: Calculating accuracy on a test set and iterating to improve classification performance.
- Feature Engineering: Experimenting with word features and optimizing the value of 𝑘 k to enhance the model's predictions.
- Natural Language Processing (NLP): Feature extraction through word stemming.
- Data Preprocessing: Randomly permuting and splitting datasets into training and test sets.
- Data Visualization: Creating scatterplots and visualizations to explore feature relationships.
- Python Libraries: Using libraries like NumPy, pandas, seaborn and Matplotlib for data manipulation and visualization.
